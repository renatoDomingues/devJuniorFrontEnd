                    Why study programming? 
                    When you learn programming, it is not only about the knowledge you acquire, but also (and specially) about the useful transferable skills you get. And the fact is that, in addition to becoming more precise and methodic, when you learn programming, you significantly improve your problem solving and abstraction skills.
                    When you hear the word “Programming”, what do you feel? Do you get scared? Does it sound interesting to you?
                    “Programming” normally provokes different reactions, and it is true that programming is not an easy task (although programming nowadays is easier than it used to be in the past). However, learning programming does have many benefits, and in this blog entry we will review some of them. In particular, we are going to show you six reasons why you should learn programming.
                </p>
                <h2> 6 Reasons why you should learn Programming? </h2>
                <p>One to get money, two to become a better boss (or workmate), thre to satisfy your curiosity, four to automatize your daily tasks, 5. To become more methodic and 6. To improve your problem-solving and abstraction skills</p>
                <h2> Skill </h2>
                <p>
                    A programmer needs to know how to analyze a problem, its context and at the same time consider the user's needs to develop the best solutions. He must be able to observe and scrutinize a situation to then transform it into codes and commands.

                <h2> 6 Reasons why you should learn Programming? </h2>
                <p>
                    1 - To get money:
                    Did you that according to several studies (check for example [1], [2] and [3]) software developer is the most in-demand job in the world? Yes, the world needs tons of programmers: for data science, application development, web development… No matter which field you like the most, there will be a job for you out there if you learn programming.
                </p>
                <h2> What is HTML and CSS </br> Your difference </h2>
                <p>
                    2 - To become a better boss (or workmate):
                    You do not want to become a programmer? That’s fine! However, you will most probably need to work with programmers, or even manage them. According to my experience as a developer and business analyst, there is normally a big gap between business people and IT people. It looks like we do not understand each other, as if we speak different languages… IT people should think more in terms of business impacts and user experience (rather than just in technologies), and business people should get a better understanding of the complexity of technologies and programming. We basically need to get a better understanding of each one’s needs.
